# HOMEWORK_WK1_Mimir

## Task that I have done:

### Git and Repository Setup:
* I have created the repository for the first week assignment in the git hub and cloned it to the git bash.
* I used the terminal to create a index.html for the repository.
* I input the the mock up and style .css in the file of the repository for the use of improving it and cleaning.
* The images I had to put in was quite difficult for me to make them show up in the browser.

### The changes I have made to the Mock up:
* I added a Display Flex to the header div ul for them become adjacent to browser when making it smaller or bigger.
* Changed the colors of the body div background to colors that looked apealing.
